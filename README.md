# ls-mdt

A Tebex store initially sold a product called "ls-mdt" encrypted but it has been taken down after we sent a notice to Tebex claiming they violate our [ps-mdt](https://github.com/Project-Sloth/ps-mdt) license.

However, they still sell an open source version of the same product with a modified user interface for $70.

They are able to do so because the script is licensed under the GPLv3 license which allows for open source code to be sold. 

However, the license also allows for the open source code to be distributed, we bought it so you don't have too. Credits to someone for sending us these files.
